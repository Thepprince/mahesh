We at LearnClue have come up with the next level revolutionary concept of making the Abacus accessible digitally through mobile app in Android and IOS. Our application suits best for the children of 6-14 years of age. In this application a child can access the Abacus virtually in a mobile app. The student will be guided by experts through scheduled regular live sessions.
